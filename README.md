 ## What is ArmoniK.Core?

This project is part of the [ArmoniK](https://github.com/aneoconsulting/ArmoniK) project. ArmoniK.Core is responsible for the implementation of the services needed for ArmoniK which are defined in [ArmoniK.Api](https://github.com/aneoconsulting/ArmoniK.Api).

ArmoniK.Core provides services for submitting computational tasks, keeping track of the status of the tasks and retrieving the results of the computations. The tasks are processed by external workers whose interfaces are also defined in ArmoniK.Api. ArmoniK.Core sends tasks to the workers, manages eventual errors during the execution of the tasks and manages also the storage of the task's results.

More detailed information on the inner working of ArmoniK.Core is available [here](https://armonikcore.readthedocs.io/).

## Development process

This repository follows trunk based development so all features will be integrated into main, in multiple small steps.
Breaking changes will be limited as much as possible or gated behind feature flags.
If breaking changes should happen, they will be documented in the releases.
Therefore, features in development or testing that cannot fit within a branch and need to be integrated into main will be marked as preview so that users know that these features are still in development and subject to changes.

**General availability (GA):** The APIs, plugins and features are thoroughly tested and support is available.
**Preview:** The APIs, plugins and features that are available on main but still in development. Their API should be stable enough for advanced users who want to test them before GA. Breaking changes should be minimal and will be notified in the release notes. Any feedback or issue encountered with these features are welcome !
**Beta (Internal preview):** The APIs, plugins and features in active development. They are not stable enough and breaking changes may occur without any notice. Breaking changes will not always be documented. They can be used by the community for testing purposes. Before being  moved to the "Preview" stage, issues might be closed with the minimal messages "Under Active Development".
**Deprecated:** The deprecated APIs, plugins and features. Features are flagged for future removal. Only production critical bug fixes will be considered.
**Work in progress (WIP):** The APIs, plugins and features are not fully implemented and may have some missing parts.
